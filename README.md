My learning notes for ML SYS.

## Guided Course

- [LLM Inference Systems: A Code-First Course](./course/README.md): a 10-week path through request lifecycles, scheduling, KV cache, attention backends, CUDA Graphs, parallelism, quantization, decoding, and profiling, with commit-pinned source readings and hands-on labs.

I've been writing this blog series intermittently for over a year now, and it's almost become an RL Infra Learning Note 😂

I often see discussions about whether ML SYS or AI Infra is worth getting into, and how to start. Everyone's choice is different. For me, I simply want to **pursue the truth in algorithms**:

> A large number of RL conclusions derived from papers are based on RL infrastructure in the open-source community that may be extremely flawed. I've been involved in RL infra development for over a year, and I've seen numerous community experts diligently working, but the fact is that RL infra, whether open-source or within major companies, still has many problems. It is absolutely worth questioning whether the high-level conclusions drawn from this flawed infrastructure are correct. When I was reviewing for ICLR this year, I often asked the papers assigned to me, "If the framework you are using has implementation issues itself, can your conclusions still hold?" Although I never deducted points for this reason, no one could provide an answer that resolved my fundamental doubt.
>
> Therefore, some excellent researchers I know are keen to participate in infra development, spending most of their time on foundational work to rigorously ensure that the algorithm they plan to develop next has a correct basis. I greatly admire them and agree with such rigor—they are my role models. The same is true for our SGLang RL community. With so much human power and time, we all hope to provide the most correct and concise RL foundation possible, whether it's for companies training models or researchers developing new algorithms, with the goal of genuinely serving everyone in the community. Thank you for your recognition, and I look forward to hearing from interested friends who wish to contact me and join us!

After a year of going around in circles, this is the resolve that keeps me going in Infra: **to make a contribution to the community by building a correct foundation, thereby helping to ensure correct conclusions.**

Coming back to the topic, this series of podcasts started in August 2024, when I began learning ML SYS notes following the opportunity to use [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) during my research. It's largely written by me, with content focusing on **RL infra, online/offline inference systems, and some fundamentals of AI Infra**. Over the past year, starting from two or three articles and thirty to fifty Github Stars, to now exceeding 4.5K Stars, I have become a minor technical influencer. I am deeply honored and grateful for the support.

**I would like to thank my advisors, Professor Quanquan Gu, Dr. Ying Sheng, and Dr. Linmin Zheng**, for the immense help and guidance they gave me in my study of AI Infra, career choices, and life path. Although I am no longer pursuing a Ph.D. at UCLA due to personal reasons, this journey after my undergraduate graduation has been an incredibly valuable experience. I have now joined RadixArk full-time, continuing my research in RL Infra. We will continue to share AI Infra-related technology and thoughts through my blog, via unofficial channels. **I also hope readers interested in AI Infra reach out to us, join the SGLang open-source community, and together build open-source AI Infra that changes the world and is worth being proud of for a lifetime!**

- [NCCL and SGLang](./torch/nccl/readme_en.md): Application of NCCL in SGLang. This is very similar to the Chinese content but includes some additional notes on parallel strategies. I probably won't complete this note and will write a separate one to record parallel strategies.
- [PyTorch Distributed](./torch/torch-distributed/readme.md): Communication practice with `torch.distributed`, details on GIL and `all_reduce`. This part is also available on [Zhihu: PyTorch Communication Practice](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/5853094319).
- [[Original][In-Depth][PyTorch] DDP Series Part 1: Introductory Tutorial](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/178402798): Although I didn't fully grasp the DDP content, I used this to learn about GIL and ring all reduce. This step is recorded in the [Postscript of torch-distributed](./torch/torch-distributed/readme.md#gil).
- [Detailed Explanation of nvidia-smi Command and Some Advanced Tips](https://www.yourmetaverse.cn/deep_learning/199/): Mainly about network topology; my local results are recorded in the [NCCL section](./torch/nccl/readme.md#nvlink-查询).

## Developer Guide

- [How to use docker](./engineer/how-to-use-docker/readme_en.md): How to use Docker to manage development environments. Please note that to collectively foster a good research environment and prevent others from being annoyed by the baseline "it runs on my machine," learning Docker is essential for everyone. We also have a [Chinese version](./engineer/how-to-use-docker/readme.md) and [Zhihu](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/1916764175230801287).
- [Setting up a Clean Development Environment](./engineer/uv/readme.md): Setting up a clean development environment. Also available on [Zhihu: Setting up a Clean Development Environment](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/23440683394).
- [Compiling and Deploying Jupyter Notebooks as Documentation on CI](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/2382351079)
